## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learned flexbox more clearly and specifically.
I learned how to use diffrent background images using css. 
I learned to use css variables.
I learned to use async to load fonts asynchonously.
I learned to use fallback font as sans serif, in case if the google fonts fails to load.
I learned to use transition on button for smooth hovering. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
:root {
  --pale-blue: hsl(225, 100%, 94%);
  --bright-blue: hsl(245, 75%, 52%);
  --bg-white: #fff;

  --very-pale-blue: hsl(225, 100%, 98%);
  --desaturated-blue: hsl(224, 23%, 55%);
  --dark-blue: hsl(223, 47%, 23%);

  --normal-font-weight: 500;
  --bold-font-weight: 700;
  --bolder-font-weight: 900;
}
```

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

I want to continue with flexbox as I am not yet very good at it.
